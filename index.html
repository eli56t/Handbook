                  known facilities is that we have a relationship with the volunteers and staff and we have reliable contacts to do temperament

                <p>Every animal is different and so what you can expect is different. Even with a well-adjusted dog or cat who has been a loved member
                  of a family may experience some stress and challenges transistioning to your home.<br><br>Dogs might have accidents on the floor
                  (even with frequent walks) as the dog learns a new routine and you learn his “signals”. There will probably be some whining and
                  clingy behavior. He will probably not eat the first day. Your resident dog may constantly want to play, or on the flip side growl
                  and be irritated that another dog has taken over. You can expect nearly every foster dog to whine and fuss in the crate overnight at
                  first.<br><br>Cats will likely be quite shy and maybe even scared initially. When bringing home a cat who's unfamiliar to your home,
                  we always recommend to first contain them in a spare room, bathroom or even in a dog crate/cage. While it may seem cruel to keep
                  them cooped up for the first 24-72 hours, it is absolutely necessary and will allow the cat to feel safe and adjust to your home
                  more effectively. Be patient and take it slow, cats tend to do things at their own pace and on their own time.<br><br>Those who has
                  never been a “pet” like hunting dogs or a stray cat who has only lived outside, you can expect a rockier adjustment period. Being
                  confined inside with new sounds, stairs, no manners as far as stealing food from counters, are not house-trained/litter trained, and
                  may dislike containment in a crate. Some have never even been on a leash or know the difference between a dog toy and your favorite
                  pair of shoes.<br><br>That being said, everyone will come across problems that they don't know how to handle. That's where asking
                  for advice and talking with your fellow foster families can be extremely useful. If you incur a problem, don't wait until you are
                  frustrated to seek help. We are HAPPY to help!!</p>

                <p>This is of course a very broad question because all organizations are run differently. Part of what makes us different is our very
                  relaxed nature. Volunteering is supposed to be fun. Our group has a very family feel to it. We don't have strict rules or
                  formalities. No one volunteer is more important than another. We are all here to have fun, make friends, and save some lives. We
                  don't do drama. We don't get caught up in rivalry. We believe in teamwork. We try to always be kind to one another, welcoming to new
                  faces and always appreciative of every member of this group.<br><br>We believe YOU are best one to judge which animal is right for
                  you home, which is why, with a bit of guidance at first, foster families choose the animals they want to pull. Along the same lines,
                  you also have the final say on who adopts the animal. We want you to feel 100% confident with where this animal is to spend the rest
                  of his life. You know him. You are invested in him. We trust YOU to be the best judge.<br><br>Another way we are different from many
                  rescues, is that we don't just take in the “easy to adopt” animals. While we try to keep a variety of animals in our care, we are
                  dedicated to assisting as many special needs animals as our space, budget, and resources allow. There are NO paid members of this
                  organization. Another unique feature of CVRR is that we post our profits and losses monthly. We are as transparent as we can
                  possibly be and welcome any financial inquiries. The first 30 minutes of our monthly board meeting is even open to the public so
                  everyone has an opportunity to ask questions of the board.</p>

                <p>Young kittens tend to be adopted within 1-2 months. Older kittens and young, adult cats are usually adopted within 3-6 months.
                  Older, adult cats can take longer to be adopted, depending on their personality.<br><br>Small breed adult dogs are usually adopted
                  within 2-4 weeks (small seniors average between 3-6 months). Medium and large sized mixed breeds (which are not bully breeds or
                  large hounds) usually are adopted in 3-6 months (seniors are closer to 6-12 months). Most medium and large purebred dogs between 1-3
                  months. Bully breeds and hounds over 35 pounds average 6-12 months. Puppies tend to be adopted within 2 months.<br><br>It's not an
                  exact science. Much of how fast an animal is adopted has to do with how many pictures, videos, cute stories you provide. Some of it
                  is just dumb luck. Sometimes wonderful well- adjusted dogs and cats sit for months with no interest.</p>

                <p>Because we have no facility, we want you to feel as confident as possible that the foster you choose is a reasonably good match for
                  the relatively short amount of time that he will be with you. Consider choosing a foster that is well-rounded and an easy keep. That
                  way, if there is a reason it does NOT work out, it is easier to find an alternate foster family. That said, we want you to view this
                  as a real commitment. We do not like to play musical fosters just because a foster's personality is not to your liking.<br><br>In
                  the case of aggression, inner household issues between resident pets and fosters, cat chasing, or if for some reason your home is a
                  danger (i.e., routinely escaping), we will either shift the animal into another foster home better-equipped for the issue, or return
                  the animal to the shelter.<br><br>Fostering is very much “learn as you go”. As each foster comes into your home, you will develop
                  more and more of a “type” that you will seek in the future. The important thing to remember is that this is a temporary commitment.
                  And that while a dog or cat may not be “YOUR type”, there is inevitably the perfect home out there waiting for them.</p>

              <div class="accordion-body">Once an application is submitted, one of our adoption counselors will skim over the application for any
                obvious disqualifications for adoption. If the application appears to be a safe and loving home (again, at a glance), we will send you
                the application to review. The first step is to call the veterinarian if applicable, which is typically done by one of our volunteers
                on the Application Team.<br><br>If they appear to show a history of good, up-to-date vet care and in other respects seem ideal for
                adoption, the next consideration is if they are the right family for this specific animal. Sometimes the family is fantastic, but not
                for the animal in which they have interest. You know your foster best, and what needs will entail.<br><br>However, I would encourage
                you NOT to make that judgment based solely upon the application. Very frequently a phone conversation or even an email will give you a
                MUCH better idea of if the adopter is well matched for the animal. It's 100% fine just to talk with them, answer any questions they
                have (alongside asking your own), then end the conversation by thanking them for their time and telling them that you will be in
                touch.<br><br>Sometimes you will have more than one good applicant for a foster. We encourage you to speak with both and decide from
                that information obtained during that conversation in conjunction with what they provided in the application. If you so choose, you
                can even have both families meet the animal before making a decision (if both are local).<br><br>Once you decide on an adopter, one of
                our adoption counselors will come assist you and walk you through your first adoption. You can familiarize yourself with the outlines
                of our contract prior to meeting the family. Amongst those agreements, that the adopter will return the animal to us if at ANY point
                they are unable to keep them. We also offer adoption trials with a non-refundable deposit. If they adopt, that money is applied to the

                <ul>
                  <li>Do not shower your foster with attention. There is a lot of adjustment and change happening. Giving him time and space to relax
                    without distraction or interference is helpful. He needs to see you as the leader of the household. Showering him with too much
                    attention could potentially confuse him as to who the boss is. With the absence of a strong leader, some dogs try to step up to
                    fill the void and are NOT good natural leaders. The extra stress causes them to exhibit behavior problems and anxiety.</li>
                  <li>Do not leave your kids unattended with the animal Regardless of any temperament test that has been done, we do NOT know this
                    animal. Until your foster knows the hierarchy and can be observed with the animal in various situations over a period of time, do
                    not take unnecessary risks.</li>
                  <li>Do not leave your pets unattended with the animal Just like with your human children, we do not want you to put your fur babies
                    in unnecessary risk either.</li>
                  <li>Do not feed him in the open where food aggression could be an issue or give any bones or toys immediately. Again...safety and
                    careful observation is prudent. We want to set both your family AND the foster up for success.</li>

                <p>It is important to note that each foster maintains a health record for the foster animal. We will do this through the Rescue Groups
                  website. The records should include dates and types of vaccines given based on any prior records and while in our care. It is
                  imperative that these records are kept accurate and sent via email to the adopter upon adoption (or prior to).<br><br>
                  <strong>Age Appropriate Vetting Required before Adoption:</strong><br>DHLPP<br>Bordetella<br>Heartworm Test<br>
                  Dewormed<br>Rabies<br><br>
                  <strong>For Adult dogs:</strong><br><br>*If we do not know their past vaccine history:<br>2 DHLPP vaccines 3-4 weeks apart<br><br>
                  *If the animal has had vaccines in the past but is not up to date:<br>1 DHLPP vaccine<br><br>
                  <strong>Puppies</strong>receive DHLPP every 3-4 weeks beginning at 7 weeks with the last booster at 16 weeks.<br><br>Rabies is
                  frequently done at the same time as spay or neuter. There are several people in the group who can implant a microchip into your
                  foster dog. This should be done immediately along with obtaining a collar and CVRR tag in case the animal gets loose.<br><br>If an
                  animal has an illness, many medications we may have “in stock” or be able to obtain without the animal seeing a veterinarian (we
                  have several experienced veterinary technicians on our team). However, if it is beyond the safe scope of our knowledge to treat, we
                  will make an appointment for the animal to be seen at one of the veterinarians that we work with routinely. We count on you to be
                  your animals advocate.

                  <p>We have several veterinarians that do pro bono work for us: Lake Forest, Rustburg Animal Hospital, and Riverside Veterinary
                    Hospital. If your foster needs to be spayed/neutered, let Susan Stanbery know and she will call and make the appointment when it
                    is a convenient time for you.<br><br>Drop off is between 7:30-8am and pick up is by 6PM on the same day at most vets. Riverside
                    requires that females remain overnight for observation. If your work does not allow for transportation then you can post on our
                    volunteer FB page and see if another volunteer is able to transport that day. When your animal goes to his alter appointment, he
                    does NOT receive any food after midnight the day before. Water is ok. When you arrive at the clinic, let the receptionist know
                    your name and that you are with CVRR and the dog's name and L#.<br><br>When you pick up your animal, he will be groggy (think one
                    too many shots of tequila). You will need to put him somewhere quiet so he can rest for the remainder of the day and night. A
                    crate or bathroom is ideal. A few hours after he arrives back home you can offer a small meal, then about 3/4 of his normal meal
                    that night. Each animal is sent home with an anti-inflammatory to start the following day after surgery so the animal is
                    comfortable. Give it with food. Give it until all the pills are gone.<br><br>Discontinue meds and contact Laura if the animal
                    starts with any vomiting or diarrhea while on the medication. The animal should not receive a bath for 7 days and attempt to keep
                    the animal relatively quiet (and not running crazy) while he heals over the following week. Each day you should peek at the
                    incision. If you notice a lot of redness, swelling or discharge at the incision site, or the animal is licking frequently, contact
                    Laura.</p>

                    arrangements on our volunteer FB page to pick up and drop off your animal. If you do not stay with your foster, it's helpful to
                    leave an index card with the basic information about your animal with whomever is handling him. Include, breed, age, likes and
                    dislikes, any adoption requirements like a companion animal or fenced yard, if he is good (or not) with children and cats, and if
                    he is house trained.<br><br>Before taking your animal out of the car be sure that his collar is very snug. Two fingers should be
                    able to slide in with NO extra wiggle room. ALL shy dogs should be on martingale collars at all times when out of the area and
                    each animal should have a tag with our information. If your foster has any kind of fear related issues, he may not last through
                    the entire event, that's ok. Better to have an abbreviated visit that starts and ends on a positive note than pushing your foster
                    longer than he is ready for. We want it to be a positive experience for everyone involved. A reminder that anytime you are at an
                    event (or wearing shirts with our logo in public) you are an ambassador for our organization. We ask that you behave in a way that
                    is in accordance with our values.<br><br>Some other helpful information about adoption events...We do not adopt animals on the
                    spot. Anyone interested in adopting needs to apply online and go through our adoption process. It takes an average of 3-5 days to
                    hear from a foster home after filling out an application, but can take as long as 7-10 days depending on schedules. We do check
                    veterinary references on any potential family who has owned animals during their adult life.</p>

                    application of flea and tick prevention upon intake. If the animal is going to require immediate bathing, it should be applied
                    after the bath. Bathing in dawn dish liquid is as effective as any flea and tick shampoo at killing the fleas on the animal but
                    should always be used in conjunction with a topical product (not instead of).<br><br>The vast number of topical applications will
                    kill ticks but not cause them to actually let go, so “tick picking” may be in order for some animals. If you remove a tick it
                    should be done with forceps and not bare fingers as the saliva is what cares tick diseases.<br><br>Sarcoptic mange, some funguses

                <p>Kennel Cough is also extremely common in shelter dogs. There is a vaccine (bordatella) that we recommend your resident dog receives
                  annually for KC. Unfortunately, even with the vaccine on board, there is still a reasonably good chance of your dogs catching the
                  virus at some point in your fostering “career” because it is SO contagious and SO common.<br><br>The vaccine tends to shorten the
                  lifespan and severity of the virus but sometimes does not prevent it entirely from occurring.<br><br>The good new is that it is
                  essentially the doggy version of the common cold, and unless your animals are very old or have a compromised immune system, they
                  should kick the bug in a week or so with no lasting effects.<br><br>If your resident animal does catch kennel cough and you feel
                  that he needs a cough suppressant or medical intervention of some kind, we are happy to provide care at no cost to you.<br><br>
                  Kennel cough sounds like the dog has “something stuck in his throat”—sometimes they gag and spit up phlegm. Some will cough
                  seemingly non-stop for the first few days of the virus and as time goes on, it will lessen. Toward the tail end, the coughing will
                  mainly be in conjunction with exercise.<br><br>Remember that this is an airborne virus so do NOT take your dog out except to potty
                  while he is coughing or you will likely spread his cooties. At no point should this virus affect his appetite and usually they are
                  still mostly active. If you are concerned, always call.</p>

                <p>Less common, but potentially very dangerous is Parvo Virus. Unlike the vaccine for Kennel Cough, the Parvo vaccine (part of your
                  DHLP/P shot) will protect your dog 100 percent from contracting the virus.<br><br><strong>Unvaccinated dogs are absolutely at risk,
                    which is why we require vaccines be UTD in resident dogs.</strong><br><br>What's important to know about Parvo (for the purpose of
                  fostering) is that it is a very hardy virus. Parvo virus has been known to live in soil for a decade. That means that if you ever
                  house a puppy who is sick with parvo, any unvaccinated dogs who share the same areas will be at risk.<br><br>Indoor areas should be
                  cleaned and disinfected in a mix of 10 percent clorox/water, and animals should not be walked in the same area as a puppy who
                  possibly shed parvo virus in the spoil. We do not generally house puppies with parvo in our “standard foster homes” but if you do
                  have a puppy who is ill and a suspect for carrying a virus, keep him in an area that is small and easy to clean, spray off the
                  bottom of your shoes with diluted clorox when exiting the area. Wash your hands immediately.<br><br>Soiled blankets should be bagged
                  and tied closed until they can be put directly in the washer with detergent and diluted clorox. If you handle the puppy and your
                  clothes have been soiled, change immediately upon exiting and wash your clothes. Ideally a “wrap around” or scrub top should be worn
                  then immediately removed each time you enter and exit. (a robe works well in a crunch).</p>

                    vomiting on a bland diet, call Laura or Dani. If your foster feels lethargic in addition to vomiting, call Dani or Laura. If you

                    unless your animals are very old or have a compromised immune system, they should kick the bug in a week or so with no lasting
                    effects. If your resident animal does catch kennel cough and you feel that he needs a cough suppressant or medical intervention of
                    some kind, we are happy to provide care at no cost to you.<br><br>Kennel cough sounds like the dog has “something stuck in his
                    throat”—sometimes they gag and spit up phlegm. Some will cough seemingly non stop for the first few days of the virus and as time
                    goes on, it will lessen. Toward the tail end, the coughing will mainly be in conjunction with exercise. At no point should this
                    virus affect his appetite and usually they are still mostly active. If you are concerned, always call.<br><br><strong>If the cough
                      is accompanied by lethargy, exercise intolerance, a loss of appetite or fainting spells, call Laura or Dani
                      immediately.</strong>

              <div class="accordion-body">
                <p>This is an annoying, common problem. Most males that come from shelters are not neutered. Even if we immediately neuter the animal
                  upon intake it takes<strong>6 weeks</strong>for testosterone to totally dissipate (although usually much better within 10 days-2
                  weeks) and in some cases, in older males, it is simply a matter of habit. In males under 1, it is usually less of a problem.<br><br>
                  Un-neutered males should be treated like unhousebroken puppies. Make frequent trips outside to keep that bladder empty, supervised
                  anytime they are not crated (utilize baby gates and tethers to keep them near you). When they attempt to mark, clap your hands and
                  make a loud NO then take him immediately outdoors and praise. Cleaning the area with a urine neutralizer like Natures Miracle is
                  important. A mix of vinegar and water can be used in a pinch to clean and disinfect. Belly bands can also be utilized to protect
                  your furniture (I line them with sanitary napkins to save from having to wash it constantly)</p>

                <p>Most shelter dogs are not house-trained when they arrive in foster care. Fortunately, adults are usually much easier to house train
                  than puppies because they have mature bladders so once they get the idea of what is expected, they tend to give cues for a longer
                  period of time before having an accident. House training 101 is done in 4 weeks.<br><br>
                  <strong>Week ONE...Total doggy lock down</strong><br>For an adult, walk every 2 hours (puppies hourly or even every half hour if
                  drinking a lot). Set a timer. If you take them out and know they need to potty, but haven't (i.e., first thing in the morning), put
                  them in the crate for 10 minutes then walk again for 5 min. Still no potty? crate 10 minutes, out for 5. Dogs are easily distracted.
                  It doesn't mean they are being defiant. Be boring. Take them to the same area. Don't play. BIG party and tasty treat the moment they
                  potty. Do not give him the freedom to wander until he has relieved himself. Keep a “potty log” indicating every time he relieves
                  himself and where so you can start to note trending. He should never be more than 15 feet from you unless crated. You can also use
                  10 foot leashes and tether them to chairs (like if you are sitting at the computer). If you have a fenced in yard you should not be
                  allowing him free access to it unsupervised because then you have no idea when he has relieved himself.<br><br>
                  <strong>Week TWO...Lockdown 2.0</strong><br>For an adult, walk every 3 hours (puppies every hour or hour and a half if drinking a
                  lot) Set a timer. If you take them out and know they need to potty, but haven't (IE first thing in the morning), put them in the
                  crate for 10 minutes then walk again for 5 min. Still no potty? crate 10 minutes, out for 5. Do not give him the freedom to wander
                  until he has relieved himself. Keep a “potty log” indicating every time he relieves himself and where so you can start to note
                  trending. If he did relatively well last week, you can try to utilize baby gates this week rather than tethering, but he should
                  still never out of sight unless crated. If he is a little slower picking up on house training, that's ok...stick to tethering again
                  this week as well. If you have a fenced in yard you should not be allowing him free access to it unsupervised because then you have
                  no idea when he has relieved himself.<br><br>
                  <strong>Week THREE...A taste of freedom</strong><br>For an adult, walk every 4 hours (puppies every 2 hours) Set a timer. Hopefully
                  by now he is getting down to business promptly when you take him out without having to bounce back to the crate. Keep a “potty log”
                  indicating everytime he relieves himself and where so you can start to note trending. Keep using your baby gates this week. If you
                  have a fenced in yard you should not be allowing him free access to it unsupervised because then you have no idea when he has
                  relieved himself.<br><br>
                  <strong>Week FOUR...Testing</strong><br>Continue walking every 4 hours (2 hours for puppies). Set a timer. Maintain your log. You
                  can start to spread your baby gates out a little so the dog has a little more freedom but if there is an area he preferred to
                  eliminate in (like a guest room) still deny him access. Continue giving treats when he potties appropriately. You can start allowing
                  him time outside unsupervised but watch for the first few minutes to make sure he is eliminating.

                <ul>
                  <li>If your foster is pooping more than the number of meals he eats (usually 2), then you usually have an issue with either too much
                    food, the wrong kind of food (even if its quality, may just not agree with him), or parasites.</li>
                  <li>Your foster should not be eliminating in his crate. If he is see section on crate issues.</li>
                  <li>If he is asking to go out overnight make sure that you are acting only as transportation to the outdoors...this is not fun time.
                    Try taking up water a few hours before bed or push dinner a little later or earlier.</li>
                  <li>Look at the food you are feeding. Junk food tends to be higher in sodium. Sodium makes you thirsty. What goes in will come out.
                  </li>
                  <li>Always use the same cues “do you want to go out” then straight out.</li>
                  <li>Don't lollygag outside. You don't want them to get the idea that they have all day to do their business. Five minutes is enough.
                  </li>
                  <li>House training is training yourself to pay attention and maintain a schedule...he will catch on.</li>
                  <li>If you catch him having an accident, loud noise to startle/interrupt then outside.</li>
                  <li>If you find a puddle or a pile and he is done, do not punish him as he will have NO idea why you are yelling. Clean it up and
                    pay more attention next time.</li>

                  <p>Crate training uses a dog's natural instincts as a den animal. A wild dog's den is his home, a place to sleep, hide from danger,
                    and raise a family.<br><br>The crate becomes your dog's den, an ideal spot to snooze or take refuge during a thunderstorm. The
                    primary use for a crate is housetraining. Dogs don't like to soil their dens.<br><br>The crate can limit access to the rest of the
                    home while he learns the rules. Don't leave your dog in the crate too long.<br><br>A dog that's crated day and night doesn't get
                    enough exercise or human interaction and can become depressed or anxious.<br><br>Puppies under six months of age shouldn't stay in
                    a crate for more than three or four hours at a time. They can't control their bladders and bowels for that long. Crate training
                    can take days or weeks, depending on your dog's age, temperament, and past experiences.<br><br>It's important to keep two things
                    in mind while crate training:<br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>The crate should always be associated with something pleasant.</li>
                    <li>Training should take place in a series of small steps. Don't go too fast.</li>
                  </ul><br>
                  <strong>1: Introduce your dog to the crate</strong><br>Place the crate in an area of your house where the family spends a lot of
                  time, such as the family room. Put a soft blanket or towel in the crate. Take the door off and let the dog explore the crate at his
                  leisure. Some dogs will be naturally curious and start sleeping in the crate right away.<br><br>If yours isn't one of them:<br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Bring him over to the crate, and talk to him in a happy tone of voice. Make sure the crate door is open and secured so that it
                      won't hit your dog and frighten him.</li>
                    <li>Encourage your dog to enter the crate by dropping some small food treats nearby, then just inside the door, and finally, all
                      the way inside the crate. If he refuses to go all the way in at first, that's okay; don't force him to enter.</li>
                    <li>Continue tossing treats into the crate until your dog will walk calmly all the way into the crate to get the food. If he isn't
                      interested in treats, try tossing a favorite toy in the crate. This step may take a few minutes or as long as several days.</li>
                  </ul><br>
                  <strong>Step 2: Feed your dog his meals in the crate</strong><br>After introducing your dog to the crate, begin feeding him his
                  regular meals near the crate. This will create a pleasant association with the crate.<br><br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>If your dog is readily entering the crate when you begin Step 2, place the food dish all the way at the back of the crate.
                    </li>
                    <li>If he remains reluctant to enter the crate, put the dish only as far inside as he will readily go without becoming fearful or
                      anxious. Each time you feed him, place the dish a little further back in the crate.</li>
                    <li>Once your dog is standing comfortably in the crate to eat his meal, you can close the door while he's eating. The first time
                      you do this, open the door as soon as he finishes his meal. With each successive feeding, leave the door closed a few minutes
                      longer, until he's staying in the crate for ten minutes or so after eating.</li>
                    <li>If he begins to whine to be let out, you may have increased the length of time too quickly. Next time, try leaving him in the
                      crate for a shorter time period. If he does whine or cry in the crate, don't let him out until he stops. Otherwise, he'll learn
                      that the way to get out of the crate is to whine, so he'll keep doing it.</li>
                  </ul><br>
                  <strong>Step 3: Lengthen the crating periods</strong><br>After your dog is eating his regular meals in the crate with no sign of
                  fear or anxiety, you can confine him there for short time periods while you're home.<br><br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Call him over to the crate and give him a treat.</li>
                    <li>Give him a command to enter, such as "kennel." Encourage him by pointing to the inside of the crate with a treat in your hand.
                    </li>
                    <li>After your dog enters the crate, praise him, give him the treat, and close the door.</li>
                    <li>Sit quietly near the crate for five to ten minutes, and then go into another room for a few minutes. Return, sit quietly again
                      for a short time, and then let him out of the crate.</li>
                    <li>Repeat this process several times a day, gradually increasing the length of time you leave him in the crate and the length of
                      time you're out of his sight.</li>
                    <li>Once your dog will stay quietly in the crate for about 30 minutes with you mostly out of sight, you can begin leaving him
                      crated when you're gone for short time periods and/or letting him sleep there at night. This may take several days or several
                      weeks.</li>
                  </ul><br>
                  <strong>Step 4: Part A: Crate your dog when you leave</strong><br>After your dog can spend about 30 minutes in the crate without
                  becoming anxious or afraid, you can begin leaving him crated for short periods when you leave the house.<br><br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Put him in the crate using your regular command and a treat. You might also want to leave him with a few safe toys in the
                      crate.</li>
                    <li>Vary at what point in your "getting ready to leave" routine you put your dog in the crate. Although he shouldn't be crated for
                      a long time before you leave, you can crate him anywhere from five to 20 minutes prior to leaving.</li>
                    <li>Don't make your departures emotional and prolonged—they should be matter-of-fact. Praise your dog briefly, give him a treat
                      for entering the crate, and then leave quietly. When you return home, don't reward your dog for excited behavior by responding
                      to him in an excited, enthusiastic way. Keep arrivals low key to avoid increasing his anxiety over when you will return.
                      Continue to crate your dog for short periods from time to time when you're home so he doesn't associate crating with being left
                      alone.</li>
                  </ul><br>
                  <strong>Step 4: Part B: Crate your dog at night</strong><br>Put your dog in the crate using your regular command and a treat.
                  Initially, it may be a good idea to put the crate in your bedroom or nearby in a hallway, especially if you have a puppy. Puppies
                  often need to go outside to eliminate during the night, and you'll want to be able to hear your puppy when he whines to be let
                  outside. Older dogs, too, should initially be kept nearby so they don't associate the crate with social isolation. Once your dog is
                  sleeping comfortably through the night with his crate near you, you can begin to gradually move it to the location you prefer,
                  although time spent with your dog—even sleep time—is a chance to strengthen the bond between you and your pet.</p>

                  <p>If your dog whines or cries while in the crate at night, it may be difficult to decide whether he's whining to be let out of the
                    crate, or whether he needs to be let outside to eliminate. If you've followed the training procedures outlined above, then your
                    dog hasn't been rewarded for whining in the past by being released from his crate. If that is the case, try to ignore the whining.
                    If your dog is just testing you, he'll probably stop whining soon. If the whining continues after you've ignored him for several
                    minutes, use the phrase he associates with going outside to eliminate. If he responds and becomes excited, take him outside. This
                    should be a trip with a purpose, not play time.<br><br>If you're convinced that your dog doesn't need to eliminate, the best
                    response is to ignore him until he stops whining. Don't give in; if you do, you'll teach your dog to whine loud and long to get
                    what he wants. If you've progressed gradually through the training steps and haven't done too much too fast, you'll be less likely
                    to encounter this problem. If the problem becomes unmanageable, you may need to start the crate training process over again. Some
                    dogs do better with the crate further from where you sleep. Some are quieter with the crate covered with a sheet. If the dog is
                    anxious, you can try a Plug in Adaptil (which is a natural pheromone to relax, or a composure tablet before bed, another natural
                    supplement). Also be sure that the crate is large enough for him and that he gets enough exercise prior to being crated.</p>

                <div class="accordion-body">
                  <p>Does your dog freak out in the crate? Pant nonstop, filling the crate and himself with drool, howl or bark for hours on end, or
                    does he try to fight his way free, breaking the crate bars/gate and his teeth/nails in the process? No matter what his level of
                    distress, the following protocol can help most dogs learn to accept the crate again:<br><br>
                    <strong>Start with the Bottom Half</strong><br>Get a plastic crate. If your dog is housebroken, this crate can be as large as you
                    like and can afford. Take it apart and put the bottom of the crate in his “safe spot”. Put a rug or towel under it if sits on tile
                    or hardwood flooring to prevent it from slipping or rattling when your dog steps into it. Store toys in the half-crate, leave a
                    trail of treats from the entrance to the way back with several treats, against the back wall. (This way he gets the biggest reward
                    for braving going in.) Feed him in it. Start with the bowl just outside the crate, then just inside and then toward the back. Give
                    him most of his attention for being near the crate at first, then standing in it, then sitting in it and then lying down. Anytime
                    you find him in it, calmly praise him. He's the BEST dog when he is in that crate. Stack the deck! Restrain him (either by tying
                    him or having a helper hold him) and show him that you are putting a favorite toy, food dispensing toy or treat in the half crate.
                    Go to him, get him all revved up and then release him with an “Okay!” What does that do? That gets him thinking, “Wow, the CRATE!
                    I get to go to the crate! Can I please go, can I, can I?”<br><br>
                    <strong>Add the Top Half</strong><br>When he is loving his half crate, securely fasten on the top half (but no door yet) and
                    repeat as above. He'll probably progress quickly. If that happens, put on the door.<br><br>
                    <strong>Add the Door</strong><br>You now have a dog who loves his crate but hasn't been closed into it yet. Start slowly, close
                    the door while he works on his food dispensing toy. Stay close by, read a magazine or watch TV. If your dog stands up, whines or
                    seems restless in his crate, run a long line (10-15 feet) from his flat collar, under the crate door to you. Apply light pressure
                    to the leash; this will apply light pressure to the back of your dog's neck, a cue to lie down that he already knows from The
                    Guided Down. (If he doesn't, start teaching him that today.) When he downs, release the pressure. Repeat as needed until he starts
                    to stay down. When he holds the down for 10 seconds or so instead of instantly popping back up, go over without comment and stick
                    a treat through the gate. Good dog. Quit while you're ahead with these games. You can always do another session a little later.
                    <br><br>When you let him out ignore him. There should be NO excitement coming out of the crate, all is calm. The best things
                    happen when he is IN his crate. From there, start moving around the room while your dog is in the crate be relaxed and calm. Leave
                    the long line on your dog so you can help him with the Guided Down if he starts to stress. Between practice sessions, prop the
                    door open and continue to put treats and toys in there, continue to give him the best attention when he is in the crate. Remove
                    all other dog beds from the area; we want the crate to be the best spot available.

                  <p>Teaching your puppy or dog what “off” means when all is calm is time very well spent. This is called “pretraining,” and the idea
                    is that if we teach our companions what we want when all is calm and relaxed, then we have it ready to go when things are more
                    exciting.<br><br>Here's how you do it:<br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Work in a calm area, where you are the most exciting thing around. Have your puppy or dog on a four-foot leash.</li>
                    <li>Have a few treats in the hand holding the leash or in your pocket.</li>
                  </ul><br>Now, back up away from your pup.<br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Pulse/squeeze the leash if you need to.</li>
                    <li>Praise your puppy so he is focused on you.</li>
                    <li>As he approaches, stop, say “off” as you put your empty hand out toward his face in the universal “stop” signal and rock
                      slightly forward.</li>
                    <li>He should stop, he may sit.</li>
                    <li>Smile, praise</li>
                    <li>What a smart puppy! Reward him with a treat or two and repeat.</li>
                  </ul>Common Questions<br>But he didn't jump up, you say. True, but that's okay. He's learning that he is rewarded for stopping
                  and/or sitting when he sees that hand signal. That'll work. He's not focused on me when I back up. Try putting the treat to his nose
                  then stashing it back in the leash holding hand just before you back up. That may pique his interest. He jumps up. Try stopping and
                  rocking forward a little faster, a bit more abruptly. See if that helps. Be sure you don't have food in the “stop” hand. Try
                  stopping and rocking forward sooner, when he is farther from you. He turns away and leaves. Go a little slower and a bit softer. You
                  may have a sensitive flower on your hands and less is more with many sensitive dogs.<br><br>Can I say “Down”? Please don't; as
                  people we use “Down” to mean both lie down and get off, but having two meanings for one word is confusing for any dog. Keep things
                  simple: “Off” means to get off of something and “Down” means to lie down.</p>

                <div class="accordion-body">
                  <p>Mouthing is a playful behavior most pups indulge in, which involves their mouth on your flesh. It is generalized (meaning they
                    mouth everyone equally), some breeds mouth more than others and the beginning of teething (around four months of age) can bring it
                    to a crescendo. It also can be painful and annoying, and it is always something we want to stop.<br><br>
                    <strong>DO:</strong><br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Pet him with long, slow strokes. Fast petting and “roughing” his face can cause him to mouth.</li>
                    <li>Make sure no one is roughhousing with your puppy, as that often leads to a mouthy puppy.</li>
                    <li>Make sure he is sleeping enough. Growing pups need lots of sleep during the first six months. If he consistently gets mouthy
                      after a lot of time awake, he may need a nap more than he needs ”training.”</li>
                    <li>Make sure he's getting enough physical exercise. Pups, like kids, go a little wonky if they can't run around and let the
                      youngness out every day. A bored, pent up puppy is an obnoxious puppy, so, no matter the weather or the reason, get that puppy
                      out to play!</li>
                    <li>Make sure he's getting enough mental exercise. Space games and self-control games help teach your pup to make the right
                      choices and demand that he think and choose. Thinking tires, so make him think!</li>
                    <li>Get him around canine playmates. Ideally older sensible dogs who will explain the rules of mouth use to him in ways only
                      canines can.</li>
                    <li>Freeze when his mouth goes on you and “yelp” loudly, try to be as startling as possible. If he removes his mouth, great. Now,
                      don't try to pet him right away just calmly praise him verbally.</li>
                    <li>If you were playing, stop the game. Mouthing = no more play.</li>
                    <li>Reach under his jaw, take his collar in hand and gently pull him toward the arm or leg he is mouthing, then hold steady. Most
                      pups will, after a few seconds, try to pull away. Good, release and let him pull away. This is called the oppositional reflex
                      (which is one of the reasons walking on leash is such a challenge). You might was well reap the benefits of it.</li>
                    <li>Leave a leash on him in the house when you are home. This allows you to deal with him calmly and effectively without having to
                      put a hand near the jaws.</li>
                    <li>Do the “calm = release” exercise (gently restraining Fido through his squirming...think HUG...when he relaxes in your arms,
                      immediately let go and calmly praise.</li>
                    <li>Supply good chew toys at the right times. When raising pups, we keep large compressed rawhides in the house. We recommend and
                      use Castor and Pollux brand, don't bother buying cheap versions as they are thin layers over scrap bits in the middle. Good
                      quality brands are sheets of thick rawhide layered together, making a long-lasting chew toy.</li>
                    <li>First thing in the AM and again in the evening, I rub the toy in my hand and blow on it (meaning I put my scent on it) and
                      then I hand it to the pup. Usually this leads to 20-30 minutes of intense chewing. Perfect. We all get a break and the pup gets
                      to use those jaws for good. Oh, and remove the toy after 1/2 an hour, that way they stay excited each time they get it.</li>
                    <li>Tether the puppy. Tie the leash to something sturdy then clip it to the pup's flat buckle collar. Tether him nearby so he can
                      be in the room but not under foot and not grabbing your shoelaces, chomping your pant legs, etc.</li>
                    <li>Binaca (a breath spray in a small canister that fits in the palm of your hand). Tuck it into your palm so it is out of sight.
                      When your pup latches on, go very still and calmly tell him, “Stop it” or “No Bite” then, right after you say that, give a quick
                      spray downward toward where your puppy's mouth is, it should be delivered from above and toward your body. The moment your pup
                      releases, calmly praise him but do not try to pet him.</li>
                    <li>Separate, leash, tether or crate your pup when any young children in your life start to get loud and active. Few pups can
                      resist joining in and the only way they really can join in is with mouth open. Nothing good will come of it. Save puppy and
                      child time for calmer moments when success, for all, is easier to create and reward.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <strong>DON'T:</strong><br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Don't grab or hit his muzzle. Too often this teaches pups to either target the hands for intense mouth contact (not exactly a
                      bite but no longer “playful” mouthing either) or it makes your puppy hand shy. Either way, there are more effective and less
                      problematic choices.</li>
                    <li>Don't squeal and run away. Doing that makes you one giant squeaky toy, and very few pups of any breed or age will be able to
                      resist giving chase.</li>
                    <li>Don't link mouthing with toys. Meaning if every time his mouth goes on you, you get a toy to “distract him,” you are actually
                      teaching him that mouthing is rewarded with play. Instead, do a Guided Down or a Simple Sit and, once he is momentarily calm,
                      THEN give the toy. That way calm and self-control = reward. That's a step in the right direction!</li>
                    <li>Don't spray into his face or up his nose with breath spray. Spray down toward where he is mouthing on you.</li>
                    <li>Don't show him the breath spray canister to get him to stop, because then you will have a puppy who respects the canister and
                      not your words.</li>
                    <li>Don't mistake serious intent with mouthing. And yes, pups can have serious intent. In general, if pups protest something
                      specific, grab and hold on, grab and shake, or puncture skin you need to seek qualified professional help right away.

                  <p>Pulling is a super common problem. The fact is that walking beside you is probably a little mind numbingly boring when you COULD
                    be sniffing all that the world has to offer. Have the right tools. No retractable leads. Every dog is different when it comes to
                    tools that can help training. Prong collars, gentle leader head halters, no pull harnesses can all be good if used correctly. When
                    you start leash training, bring out the good stuff...chicken, cheese, turkey. It has to be more interesting than the dead squirrel
                    on the side of the road. If you have a hound, it has to be more interesting than the dead squirrel three zip codes away.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Start on the right foot. You don't move until he is focused on you.</li>
                    <li>Shorten your leash so the dog is next to you but the lead shouldn't be right or they will naturally pull against the pressure
                      (think chinese finger trap). The leash should always be loose where the clip is hanging down. If you have to make a correction,
                      it's quick then then slack again.</li>
                    <li>If your dog shoots off like a rocket, change directions for a few steps. When he catches up, good boy and treat. If she shoots
                      ahead again, switch directions again...continue...you want him focused on you and beside or behind you.</li>
                    <li>Practice claiming the space in front of him. When you are standing with your dog on your left, pivot around to face him by
                      moving your right foot around. Ask him to sit and reward. Repeat. Now take a few steps and pivot/sit....a few more steps, pivot
                      and sit. Eventually when you pivot to face him, he will sit without being asked. Start every walk with a few of these to get his
                      focus on you.</li>

                    to know to ask them...or any guest. I want them to NOT exit unless told to.<br><br>Here's how:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Option one: Check to be sure the collar is very snug and leash your dog. Open the door, wait for Fido to bolt out the door.
                      Close the door with you inside and him outside with minimum slack. Wait....keep waiting.....give it a minute or two...or 4. Open
                      the door. “Oh hi there, you want to come in?” Repeat. Over and over. Most dogs pick up on this method very, very well. OK is the
                      release word for your dog to exit.</li>
                    <li>Option two: If you have done some work with pivoting in front of your dog (for leash training) then leash your dog (for
                      safety), and when he goes to bolt, pivot in front of him. Use your body to back him away from the door. Repeat until he waits to
                      be released.</li>
                    <li>Option three: Leash dog. Open door. When dog goes to bolt out the door quickly slam the door (careful to not bump dog). Open
                      it slowly again, if he bolts repeat. Eventually he will back up and look to you...continue until he waits until the door is
                      totally open AND you have given the cue to go.</li>
                  </ul>
                  </p>

                <div class="accordion-body">
                  <p>This one isn't easy. There is some inherent reward in the chase behavior, so the more your dog does it, the more well-versed he
                    will become. This can become very serious, so being consistent in redirection and correction of this behavior before it starts
                    over the next few weeks will really be important. That said, I would also correct him if he gets fully into chase mode because you
                    were not able to catch him in time to redirect him first. If he takes off chasing, you need to be right after him, using your
                    voice as a correction tool. I want him to be immediately aware he has made a bad choice in chasing the kitty because you are very
                    upset. When you catch him, without emotion, put him into a room by himself or into his crate for a few minutes. You don't need to
                    hold a long grudge against him, but he needs to know that his chasing behavior has a serious consequence. Not only will you not
                    allow it, he will have some time alone if and when he partakes.<br><br>If you have done any obedience work with him, use your
                    recall (come, here, etc.) to work on calling him off. You may want to review his recall in contexts easier than cat-chasing at
                    first so you can build a reinforcement history for coming when called. That way, you are likely to be more successful when he is
                    otherwise distracted. This practice will help you outdoors as well with his daily recalls or off-leash behavior. Keep a leash on
                    so if you are close by you can step on it to control the situation. Make sure he is getting enough exercise. Be sure your cat has
                    a place to get away. Sometimes a super soaker squirt gun to the head is enough to convince Fido to find another hobby. If this
                    becomes an issue, moving the foster dog to a different home may be the best and safest option. We never want your resident animals
                    to be uncomfortable with a visitor.</p>

                  <p>This is another one that is very dependent on the severity of the issues and lots of other factors...size difference, are their
                    kids in the home, is the aggression centered around guarding a resource or simply generalized, has blood actually been drawn
                    verses just a lot of obnoxious posturing and growling. This one may need some hands-on help with Laura to work through but if you
                    have one dog constantly causing issues with the other, sometimes they just need a bit more structure and a reminder that you have
                    control over the situation and its their job to relax and follow.<br>A bit of “grounding” may help. Here's how... Grounding calms,
                    sweetens and refocuses such dogs in just a few days. It also can help shy/sensitive dogs feel more secure in the world and
                    confident in you.<br><br>Do this:<br>
                  <ul>
                    <strong>"Say Please"</strong>
                    <li>Dogs "say please" by obeying commands. Before you give him anything he enjoys, a command is given and obeyed. Before doing him
                      a favor, like getting a toy or letting him outside, he should "say please." Anticipating what you want is lovely but not enough
                      here, listening is what we're going for.</li>
                    <li>Dogs maintain their group status through day to day interaction, so having your dog obey you frequently keeps you quietly in
                      the driver's seat.</li>
                    <strong>Show Respect</strong>
                    <li>When you're grounded, part of the deal is being on your best behavior. If he's in your way tell him to move and make him do
                      so. If he resists, leave the lead on and guide him out of the way.</li>
                    <li>If you're walking out the door, don't allow him to shove you aside so he can go first. Put him on lead and teach him "Wait."
                      Jumping up, nose nudging and pawing to solicit attention stops. Have him "Sit" or "Down" and then reward him with your
                      attention.</li>
                    <strong>Four on the Floor</strong>
                    <li>Keep your dog on the ground and humans off the ground. This is important. Couch time and bed cuddling is earned. It is lost
                      the moment behavior goes askew and is rewarded to your dog when all else is back on an even keel. Having your dog on leash will
                      help you do this at first. Be calm, be clear, be consistent. It works, really well.</li>
                    <strong>Chores</strong>
                    <li>Doing chores is a time honored, attitude adjustment mechanism. "Chores" for your dog are obedience routines.</li>
                    <li>Three short fiveminute sessions a day will go a long way to bringing your dog's attitude around. Praise him plenty, but make
                      him work.</li>
                    <li>The formula is simple: Say it, Follow through, Reward.</li>
                    <strong>Organize His Free Time</strong>
                    <li>His free time should be limited. Keep him on lead near you most of the time. Give him a toy or two but hold on to the lead.
                      When you move, he moves. The more he follows you, the more he will see you as his leader. Use commands often and
                      indiscriminately, always calmly insisting that he obey. Why? Because you say so, that's why.</li>
                    <li>Please note: We do not say "Tie the dog to you" please don't do that! Hold on so you can pulse, guide, help when that is
                      needed. When your dog is calm and entertaining himself, by all means drop the lead and let him. But if he starts to get into
                      trouble, calmly pick it back up and get him organized again.</li>
                    <strong>Go To His Room</strong>
                    <li>Most "problem" dogs benefit from a crating schedule. Even if you are home all the time, crate him for at least three hours in
                      the morning and three hours in the afternoon. This helps to establish good behavior, stop destructive cycles and teach him to
                      sleep when you're out or busy.</li>
                    <strong>Less Attention</strong>
                    <li>Many problem dogs get too much attention. If you're averaging more than ten minutes of attention per hour when you are home,
                      then you need to cut back.</li>
                    <li>Attention means talking to or petting. Lying at your feet or taking a walk do not count. Going over to your dog and petting
                      him is particularly detrimental. Dogs cannot help but interpret this as submissive behavior on your part. If you want him to be
                      enthused about being praised, make him work for it. If it is a little more rare, it will be a little more dear.</li>
                    <strong>A Dozen Downs a Day</strong>
                    <li>A dozen downs a day for a few weeks will help make "down" second nature for your dog; mentally making him more accepting and
                      responsive. Don't do them all in a row, ask for them when your dog least expects it. Hint: Pretrain the guided down so you can
                      create a down easily from light pressure if your dog doesn't respond.</li>
                    <strong>Exercise</strong>
                    <li>This much change can be stressful for your dog. Plenty of exercise is required to help him through the first few weeks of this
                      new program. If done properly, he will be getting plenty of attention, but in a more productive way. Have Fun!</li>
                    <li>Teach some silly tricks or a new command that amuses you. Have a good time with your dog.</li>
                    <li>that is the reason you have a companion. Changing the way your dog relates to you doesn't mean you stop enjoying each other.
                    </li>
                  </ul><br>Also, it's important to note who the strongest “leader” between the two dogs is, and support that dog. It may not be the
                  dog you prefer. Your personal preference does not matter. Your “alpha” may be more comfortable with the situation, and less likely
                  to constantly try to “make his point” when he sees you have his back. That means greeting him and feeding him first. Showing obvious
                  preferential treatment. Some other things to remember, watch the dogs on close quarters or times of anxiety, like when the doorbell
                  rings. Be one step ahead of the game. Do not allow them to play with prized toys together or rawhides of any kind. Just like with
                  the cat situation, we never want anyone to get hurt so this is one behavioral situation that it may be in everyone's best interest
                  to try the dog in a different foster home.</p>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Let your foster see other dogs traverse the steps</li>
                    <li>Put some cheese on the first step or lure him by putting it at his nose and guiding him down with your hand gently on his
                      collar. You may have to pull him a bit the first time. Reward frequently</li>
                    <li>Ignore it....he will come around</li>
                    <li>Make it a game...get him riled up then throw a ball down the steps</li>

                <div class="accordion-body">
                  <p>First, I think it's important to say that no dog should be labeled with generalized anxiety until he has been in a foster home
                    for 3 weeks at least. Changing homes and environments is scary and a little anxiety (or a lot) is normal. However, if it continues
                    for a month or more and your foster has a very hard time settling down, follows you from room to room, pants and paces, shakes or
                    is destructive it may be a sign of generalized anxiety.<br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>First reward calm behavior. If you see Fido laying down, don't say anything but “drive by treat” meaning just walk by and let
                      food fall from the sky.</li>
                    <li>Really work on that crate training. The crate can be really helpful with anxious dogs, giving him a place that's safe of his
                      very own.</li>
                    <li>“Ground” him. Read about grounding under <a href="#issues">Issues with Resident Dogs</a>.</li>
                    <li>Reward the behavior you want and ignore what you don't want</li>
                    <li>Composure is a natural supplement that can help with anxiety. Amazon carries it</li>
                    <li>Adaptil makes a collar that is a natural calming pheromone for dogs. Also found on amazon.</li>
                    <li>Dogs with anxiety can really be helped by confidence building exercises.</li>
                  </ul><br>A game called “check it out” where you gradually move closer to a scary object (could be anything from a bag on the floor
                  to a manhole). At first you only take a few steps toward it....reward and have fun. Back to your starting point and ignore your dog
                  for a moment or two. Next time walk a few steps closer. Try to have fun. Reward every step of the way. Retreat back to the starting
                  place and be boring again. Wait again for a few moments ignoring your dog while at your starting place a distance away from the
                  item. Repeat the process again going closer yet to the scary object. The ideas is you want him to WANT to go closer to the item
                  because you are making it fun. When you move away you give him time to relax and take a much needed mental break but it's boring.

                  <p>These days, any “home alone” issue seems to be labeled “Separation Anxiety” (SA). To sort out what it is from what it isn't, here
                    are other reasons for problems unrelated to SA:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Breed Normal Behavior</li>
                    <li>Developmentally Normal Behavior</li>
                    <li>Opportunity</li>
                    <li>Inadequate Care</li>
                    <li>Random and Highly Variable Behavior in an Otherwise Calm-When-Alone Dog</li>
                    <li>Mislabeled Behavior</li>
                  </ul>
                  <strong>Normal Behavior</strong><br>Retrievers were bred to love to pick things up in their mouths. A retriever that chews is a
                  normal retriever, just as a terrier who digs or barks is a normal terrier and a scent hound or Nordic breed that barks or howls is
                  to be expected. “Normal” is not to be confused with acceptable, wanted or unchangeable, it simply means it is not a sign of
                  dysfunction.<br><br>
                  <strong>Developmentally Normal Behavior</strong><br>This category generally shows up at the beginning or toward the end of life. A
                  young pup who is in the extra playful, extra mouthy, teething phase of things will grab and chew and yank and rip because that's
                  what pups at that age do. Protecting them from themselves is as key as protecting your house from them. Intact male dogs may do a
                  number on your home if they see another male dog entering your yard or if a female comes into heat within sniffing range (and that
                  range can be a mile or more). We recommend pet dogs be neutered; it just makes life easier for all concerned. As a dog ages, hearing
                  and eyesight can fade, the mind can drift and behavior can change. If your older dog who has been fine his entire life has recently
                  developed a problem, please speak to your veterinarian before you get frustrated with your old friend.<br><br>
                  <strong>Opportunity</strong><br>Nothing mysterious here. Your dog likes to eat garbage. You leave the can out when you exit the
                  house. Your dog tips the can and feasts. He's having a perfectly nice time doing that, nothing the least bit anxious going on, any
                  more than me picking off a brownie from a plate of freshly baked deliciousness cooling on the counter is a sign of anxiety. Nope,
                  simply opportunity combined with desire.<br><br>
                  <strong>Inadequate Care</strong><br>A dog who urinates in the house when left alone for 12 hours is a normal dog. Some dogs can hold
                  it that long, but could you? If you could not, would that make you someone with a behavioral issue? Certain individual dogs and
                  certain breeds need specific care. A young Weimaraner needs to run. If he doesn't get a chance to run daily expect him to develop
                  behavior "problems"; he has no other choice. He needs what he needs.<br><br>So, before you get frustrated with your dog, see if your
                  dog has any reason to be frustrated with you. If his basic needs are not being met, that has to be addressed first and foremost.
                  Once you have, then review his behavior. You may find that things improve to a nearly miraculous degree. Random and highly variable
                  behavior in an otherwise calm-when-alone dog Here a dog who is usually calm starts having trouble. If this isn't a medical issue,
                  this may be caused by some new event happening outside the house. Frequent delivery trucks pulling up before the holidays, meter
                  readers coming into your yard, a new cat lingering near your dog's favorite window, a new neighbor with kids running around next

                  <strong>Mislabeled behavior</strong><br>This is a big category, one defined by simple human confusion. A dog who whines with
                  excitement when he hears a familiar car pull into the garage or barks at guests when they leave isn't exhibiting separation issues.
                  He's just excited to have you home or is confused about how to respond when people are leaving.<br><br>

                  <p>Many foster homes are in a rush to start socializing their foster dog. When he first arrives, it's best to give him a week (or
                    more depending on his disposition) to relax, settle in, and gain confidence in you as a leader. When you do start socializing him,
                    keep it fun! Always have treats, don't get upset if the outing is cut short. Pay close attention to his body language (information
                    about identifying anxious body language can be found under “adoption events” in chapter one) Better to be short and successful
                    than long and a catastrophe. Dont skip from kindergarten to college. Start in areas that aren't very busy and gauge your foster
                    dog's behavior. Are you able to get his attention? Does he seem relaxed? Will he accept a treat (like cheese...not milk bone)? If
                    he knows “sit” will he when asked? If not then you probably need to take a step back.<br><br>If he is shy of strangers start by
                    approaching people (however close you can get while the dog remains comfortable and willing to take a reward), YOU feed a treat
                    and walk away. After several outings try asking someone else to drop the teat at his feet. The idea is people = reward. Sometimes
                    I have to start in the last parking spot at petsmart and I don't get to the first parking spot over a month's time...that's ok. It

                  <p>Trainers often advise clients to put their dogs on a “Nothing in Life Is Free” program--NILIF, for short. A dog on NILIF gets
                    nothing--not attention, not food, not walks--without earning it either during a formal training session or by responding to a cue
                    such as “Sit” or “Down.” No collecting ear scratches just by resting that big doggy head on your thigh while you're trying to
                    write your next article. It sounds so grim—and yet it really shouldn't be. “Nothing in Life Is Free.”<br><br>
                    <strong>Should You Use “Nothing in Life is Free” with Your Dog?</strong><br>Framed in the usual way, NILIF makes many dog
                    guardians cringe. It makes me cringe, too. “Nothing in life is free” sounds as if the whole point of the enterprise is to turn
                    your doggy household into an outpost of some cult that bars dancing and hot chocolate. Actually, taken in the right spirit NILIF
                    functions as a teaching program based on reciprocity and exchange. You can call it “Say Please” if that makes it seem less
                    spartan; other dog-friendly trainers use “Learn to Earn.” And as far as I'm concerned, most dogs should get all the ear scratches
                    they want for free. I'll describe the exception later on. The big insight behind a “Say Please” program is that we, our dogs'
                    people, hold the key to pretty much everything a dog wants in life--walks, attention, tasty treats, a game of tug. When we use
                    rewards to train we're applying that principle. A “Say Please” program takes it further, by structuring daily interactions so
                    that, as often as possible, Dogalini gets what she wants in exchange for doing something you want. The more of these informative
                    and rewarding interactions Dogalini has, the stronger her good habits will become.<br><br>
                    <strong>How to Use NILIF/“Say Please” Throughout the Day</strong><br>Here are some examples of how “Say Please” might work in
                    daily life. If it's time to go for a walk, then instead of letting Dogalini do whatever while you put on your shoes and attach her
                    leash, you ask her to sit and stay. Here the reward is ongoing--as she holds her sit-stay, walk time gets closer and closer. If
                    she breaks her sit, you interrupt your prep for going out. Once she holds the sit long enough for you to leash her, you could ask
                    her to do a trick, then open the door to reward her for complying. As you walk, you say “Yes!” and deliver a small treat every few
                    paces as long as Dogalini stays more or less by your side. And your reward her for keeping plenty of slack in the leash by
                    offering her frequent chances to go sniff. At the dog park, you have Dogalini target your hand with her nose once or twice before
                    you unclip her lead. Back home, she can wait in a down-stay while you get her dinner ready and set it on the floor, then head for
                    her bowl when you give the okay. When you're playing fetch with her in the backyard later that evening, you ask her to sit or down
                    or do a well-known trick before every ball throw--the throw is her reward for responding to your cue. Obviously, “Say Please”
                    calls for some effort on the human's part, if you're not used to thinking much about your interactions with your dog. But it can
                    become second nature if you stick with it for a while, and of course it gets easier and easier as your dog learns to look for your
                    cues throughout the day. Still, you might wonder, why go to the trouble of learning this more structured way of relating to your
                    dog? Benefits! Big-time benefits.<br><br>
                    <strong>How to Use “Say Please” for Puppies</strong><br>You know what a puppy is? A puppy is a learning machine. Practice “Say
                    Please” with your baby Dogalini for a couple of months and you will be patting yourself on the back every single time you see the
                    out-of-control adolescent dog down the block. A puppy whose people teach manners erratically or not at all grows into a dog who's
                    clueless about human rules. A “Say Please” or “NILIF” program doesn't focus on punishment--it focuses on rewarding behaviors that
                    you like.<br><br>
                    <strong>How to Use “Say Please” for Dogs Who Need a Boost</strong><br>For the same reasons, “Say Please” works beautifully for
                    dogs who could use a little confidence. Each reward they earn by responding to you is a success for them. And an animal who knows
                    a set of consistent, workable rules for life probably experiences something like the feeling of competence and safety that we have
                    when we understand what's expected of us on the job or how we can meet a partner's needs at home.<br><br>
                    <strong>How to Use “Say Please” for Behavior Repair</strong><br>“Say Please” also comes in handy for repair work. Maybe you've got
                    that out-of-control adolescent dog and you're giving the hairy eyeball to the neighbor whose young 'un is walking so politely on
                    leash. Or your dog never learned to tolerate frustration. He's the dog who doesn't just ask for ear scratches with the
                    head-on-thigh trick he demands them. Or he'll start mouthing you when you end a game of Tug. “Whaddaya mean, 'We're done playing?'
                    We are not! No no no no no! We are not!” For these dogs, who could really use some structure, an abrupt change in the household
                    rules can knock them for a loop. Set everybody up for success by going slow. Ask for a few easy manners behaviors every day and
                    build up the “Say Please” habit a little at a time.<br><br>
                    <strong>How to Use NILIF/“Say Please” in Behavior Modification</strong><br>Frustration intolerance brings us to the
                    word-of-caution piece of this article. Some version of NILIF or “Say Please” enters into many or most behavior modification plans,
                    including behavior mod for aggression. If you're dealing with frustration intolerance that shades into outright aggression,
                    consult a good behavior professional before proceeding. Same goes if you just want to develop better manners or a better
                    relationship with your dog, but her response to a “Say Please” program turns out to worry you in any way. “Say Please” isn't harsh
                    or confrontational. If your dog reacts to it by threatening you, get help pronto.<br><br>For most of us, though, “Say Please” is
                    an easy, pleasant way to incorporate teaching and learning into everyday life with our dogs, to help a new dog learn the ropes, or
                    to bring up a shy dog's confidence. You don't need to live “Say Please” 24/7 to see benefits, by any means--start by applying it
                    consistently to just a few situations. As you get better at noticing which of your dog's behaviors pay off for her, it will become
                    natural and easy to provide those payoffs in exchange for behaviors you like.

                <div class="accordion-body">
                  <p>Sooner or later every dog lover returns home to find some unexpected damage inflicted by his or her dog; or, more specifically,
                    that dog's teeth. Although dogs make great use of their vision and sense of smell to explore the world, one of their favorite ways
                    to take in new information is to put their mouths to work.<br><br>Fortunately, chewing can be directed onto appropriate items so
                    your dog isn't destroying things you value or jeopardizing his own safety. Until he's learned what he can and can't chew, however,
                    it's your responsibility to manage the situation as much as possible, so he doesn't have the opportunity to chew on unacceptable
                    objects.<br><br>
                    <strong>1. Understand why dogs chew</strong>Puppies, like infants and toddlers, explore their world by putting objects in their
                    mouths. And, like babies, they teethe for about six months, which usually creates some discomfort. Chewing not only facilitates
                    teething but also makes sore gums feel better. Adult dogs may engage in destructive chewing for any number of reasons. In order to
                    deal with the behavior, you must first determine why your dog is chewing—and remember, he's not doing it to spite you. Possible
                    reasons for destructive chewing include:
                  <ul>
                    <li>As a puppy, he wasn't taught what to chew and what not to chew.</li>
                    <li>He's bored.</li>
                    <li>He suffers from separation anxiety.</li>
                    <li>His behavior is fear-related.</li>
                    <li>He wants attention.</li>
                  </ul>Be aware: You may need to consult a behavior professional for help with both separation anxiety and fear-related
                  behaviors.<br><br>
                  <strong>2. Teach your dog what can be chewed and what can't</strong><br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Take responsibility for your own belongings. If you don't want it in your dog's mouth, don't make it available. Keep clothing,
                      shoes, books, trash, eyeglasses and remote controls out of your dog's reach.</li>
                    <li>Give your dog toys that are clearly distinguishable from household goods. Don't confuse him by offering shoes and socks as
                      toys and then expecting him to distinguish between his shoe and yours. Supervise your dog until he learns the house rules. Keep
                      him with you on his leash in the house so he can't make a mistake out of your sight. Confine him when you're unable to keep an
                      eye on him. Choose a "safe place" that's dog proof, and provide fresh water and "safe" toys. If your dog is crate trained, you
                      may also place him in his crate for short periods of time.</li>
                    <li>Give your dog plenty of people time. Your dog won't know how to behave if you don't teach him alternatives to inappropriate
                      behavior, and he can't learn these when he's in the yard by himself.</li>
                    <li>Give your dog plenty of physical and mental exercise. If your dog is bored, he'll find something to do to amuse himself and
                      you probably won't like the choices he makes. On the other hand, a tired dog is a good dog, so make sure he gets lots of
                      physical and mental activity. The amount of exercise should be based on his age, health and breed characteristics.</li>
                    <li>If you catch your dog chewing on something he shouldn't, interrupt the behavior with a loud noise. Offer him an acceptable
                      chew toy instead, and praise him lavishly when he takes the toy in his mouth. Build a toy obsession in your dog. Use his toys to
                      feed him. At mealtimes, fill a Kong type toy with his kibble.</li>
                    <li>If your puppy is teething, try freezing a wet washcloth for him to chew on. The cold cloth will soothe his gums. Supervise
                      your puppy so he doesn't chew and swallow any pieces of the washcloth.</li>
                    <li>Make items unpleasant to your dog. Furniture and other items can be coated with a taste deterrent (such as Bitter Apple®) to
                      make them unappealing. Caution: Supervise your dog when you first try one of these deterrents. Some dogs will chew an object
                      even if it's coated with a taste deterrent. Also be aware that you must reapply some of these deterrents to maintain their
                      effectiveness.</li>
                    <li>Offer your dog a treat in exchange for the item in his mouth. As your dog catches on to this idea, you can add the command
                      "Give" as his cue to release the object in exchange for the yummy treat.</li>
                    <li>Don't chase your dog if he grabs an object and runs. If you chase him, you are only giving your dog what he wants. Being
                      chased by his human is fun! Instead call him to you or offer him a treat.</li>
                    <li>Have realistic expectations. At some point your dog will inevitably chew up something you value; this is often part of the
                      transition to a new home. Your dog needs time to learn the house rules and you need to remember to take precautions and keep
                      things out of his reach.</li>
                  </ul>
                  <strong>3. Never discipline or punish your dog after the fact</strong><br>
                  <ul>
                    <li>If you discover a chewed item even minutes after he's chewed it, you're too late.</li>
                    <li>Animals associate punishment with what they're doing at the time they're being corrected. Your dog can't reason that, "I tore
                      up those shoes an hour ago and that's why I'm being scolded now." Some people believe this is what a dog is thinking because he
                      runs and hides or because he "looks guilty."</li>
                  </ul>In reality, "guilty looks" are actually canine submissive postures that dogs show when they're threatened. When you're angry
                  and upset, your dog feels threatened by your tone of voice, body postures and/or facial expressions, so he may hide or show
                  submissive postures. Punishment after the fact will not only fail to eliminate the undesirable behavior, but it could also provoke
                  other undesirable behaviors.</p>

                  <p>Many times, dogs are left at the shelter because people never took the time to teach them basic manners. Begging at the table is
                    a very common issue because it's frequently self-rewarding. People accidently drop a bite of food and the dog is rewarded for his
                    perseverance. He is willing to stick around even when food isn't dropped for some time because...well...it's the dog version of a
                    slot machine. Sooner or later he is bond to hit a jackpot.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Don't allow him to practice bad behavior. Tether him on the other side of the room on a dog bed with a Kong stuffed with HIS
                      dinner or a bone for a few weeks</li>
                    <li>After he seem to know the routine remove the tether and see if you can instruct (and maybe guide) Fido where you want him</li>
                    <li>Add the addition of a squirt gun. If he approaches the table, give him a little squirt then tell him what you want “go to your
                      place” and guide him there</li>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Hand feed meals asking the dog to sit intermittently. This is YOUR food and you are nice enough to share it with him.</li>
                    <li>Give him his food and stay a distance away. Intermittently throw cheese his way. You want him to see your approach as
                      nonthreatening and supplying BONUS food. As he gets the hang of the game, you move closer with each training session. Don't push
                      it if you are worried at all.</li>
                    <li>DON'T yell, threaten or further PROVE that you are threat to him or his food. Lots of dogs that had to compete for meals
                      resource guard. In mild cases, just being fed regularly and left alone is enough to make the behavior dissipate.</li>

                  <p>Sometimes, dogs come from homes where they were coddled and treated like the center of the universe. Frequently these dogs are
                    the only fur child in the household. I have found senior citizens to be especially prone to overindulging their canine friends.
                    Sometimes WE are the ones who have over indulged. Dogs who come from bad places, we tend to want to overcompensate for their
                    terrible life. When we do, we can accidentally make a pushy little monster.<br><br>Dogs that harass you for attention and don't
                    quit when ignored for a brief time can get really old really fast. It can also lead to a slew of other behavior problems. For dogs
                    that push for attention, I practice the “all done” command. Most dogs dislike to be patted on their heads. Most humans don't have
                    a problem doing the patting so this is a good one because guests don't feel like they are being mean if we tell them, “if he is
                    bothering you just pat him on the head and tell him you are all done”. If Fido is annoying me, I just sort of clumsily pat him on
                    the head two or three times and tell him “all done” if he doesn't get the point, I repeat the action and body block him away
                    (think goalie). These dogs are also great candidates for “grounding” Read about grounding under <a href="#issues">Issues with

                <p>It is important to note that each foster maintains a health record for the foster animal. We will do this through the Rescue Groups
                  website. The records should include dates and types of vaccines given based on any prior records and while in our care. It is
                  imperative that these records are kept accurate and sent via email to the adopter upon adoption (or prior to).<br><br>

                  <strong>For Adult cats:</strong><br><br>*If we do not know their past vaccine history:<br>2 FVRCP vaccines 3-4 weeks apart<br><br>
                  *If the animal has had vaccines in the past but is not up to date:<br>1 FVRCP vaccine<br><br>Rabies and FeLV/FIV combo test are
                  frequently done at the same time as spay/neuter and microchip because it must be done by a veterinarian.<br><br>
                  <strong>Kittens</strong>receive FVRCP vaccine every 3-4 weeks beginning at 7 weeks with the last booster at 16 weeks; they will
                  receive<strong>at least 2 shots</strong>. Kittens cannot be spayed/neutered until they are at least 2 months old (8 weeks) and weigh
                  at least 2 pounds. Kittens<strong>cannot</strong>receive a rabies vaccine until they are 12 weeks old, and therefore, it's often
                  desirable to wait and schedule their spay/neuter at 12 weeks old so they can receive rabies in the same vet visit.<br><br>Cats must
                  never be allowed to “free roam” or be around other cats until they have been combo tested.<br><br>If an animal has an illness, many
                  medications we may have “in stock” or be able to obtain without the animal seeing a veterinarian (we have several experienced
                  veterinary technicians on our team). However, if it is beyond the safe scope of our knowledge to treat, we will make an appointment
                  for the animal to be seen at one of the veterinarians that we work with routinely. We count on you to be your animals advocate. If
                  you think he is ill, please contact Meghan, Laura, or Dani. If he needs a booster vaccine, dewormer, or flea/tick treatment, please
                  contact Meghan or Jillian.

                <p>We have several veterinarians that do pro bono work for us, but the vast number of animals go to Riverside Veterinary Hospital.
                  Laura handles all the S/N appointments. She will ask you when it will be convenient for you to take your animal for his appointment
                  & make the date accordingly.<br><br>Drop off is between 8-9 a.m. & pick-up is either at the end of the day, or alternatively the
                  following morning. If your work doesnt allow for transportation then you can post on our volunteer FB page and see if another
                  volunteer is able to transport that day.<br>When your animal goes to his S/N appointment, he does<strong>NOT</strong>receive any
                  breakfast that morning. Water is okay. When you arrive at Riverside, tell the front desk that you have a CVRR cat that has an
                  appointment; they will ask for the cats name and G#, as well as when you will be picking the cat up.<br><br>If you elect to pick up
                  your foster cat the same day, he will be groggy (think one too many shots of tequila). You will need to confine him somewhere quiet
                  so that he can rest/recover for the remainder of the day and night. A crate or bathroom is ideal. A few hours after he arrives back
                  home, you can offer a small meal, then about 3/4 of his normal meal that night.<br><br>Contact Laura, Dani, or Meghan immediately if
                  the animal appears to have any complications or adverse reactions. Attempt to keep the animal relatively quiet (and not running
                  crazy) while he heals over the next few days. Each day you should peek at the incision. If you notice a lot of redness, swelling or
                  discharge at the incision site, or the animal is licking frequently, contact Dani or Meghan.</p>

                  <p>Adoption events are occasionally scheduled for cats. You can come and stay for the event itself or make arrangements on our
                    volunteer FB page to pick up and drop off your animal. If you do not stay with your foster, it's helpful to leave an index card
                    with the basic information about your animal with whomever is handling him. Include a description, age, likes and dislikes, any
                    adoption requirements like a companion animal or dislike of other cats/dogs, if he is good (or not) with children and
                    dogs.<br><br>If your foster is particularly shy, he may not last through the entire event, that's okay. Better to have an
                    abbreviated visit that starts and ends on a positive note than pushing your foster longer than he is ready for. We want it to be a
                    positive experience for everyone involved. A reminder that anytime you are at an event (or wearing shirts with our logo in public)

                  <p>Isolation Protocol While we know that you want to let your foster roam freely and play with your own pets, its absolutely
                    necessary to keep them isolated in their “safe room” for a period of time. This is important even if you dont have any other
                    animals in your home.<br><br>The goal is to keep all animals happy & healthy. We generally require at least two weeks of isolation
                    time, however the amount of time varies depending on several factors, i.e. combo test, medical problems/treatment, & the cats
                    individual personality. When you agree to foster a cat, you will be given an estimated confinement time.<br><br>
                    <strong>*Until cats have been combo tested for FeLV/FIV (negative), they must remain completely isolated from other
                      animals.</strong><br><br>
                    <strong>Disease Prevention</strong><br>
                    <u>Known Illnesses</u>: If your foster is sick when they get to your home, they must be kept isolated so they do not infect your
                    resident animals, and so they do not spread their illness all over, leaving the possibility of reinfection.<br><br>
                    <u>Possible Illnesses</u>: Most communicable diseases will pop-up within 14 days. Cats, & kittens especially, can appear healthy
                    but may be carrying something that could develop within that time frame. By keeping fosters segregated and confined to a smaller
                    area, you are insuring that theyre not able to spread disease to any other animals or areas of your home, which can make treating
                    & eradicating the disease(s) much easier.<br><br>
                    <u>Intestinal Parasites</u>: These can be transmitted through the litterbox. Until your foster has been fully treated for
                    fleas/ticks & parasites, they should be kept isolated.<br><br>
                    <strong>Stress & Behavior Issues</strong><br>
                    <u>Adult Cats</u>: Most do best if they are slowly introduced into a new home environment. The sudden access to a large,
                    unfamiliar space can be very overwhelming and cause your foster to go into hiding, have problems using the litterbox, or even keep
                    them from eating. Just as we recommend with our adopters, foster cats should become comfortable in their “safe room,” and then
                    slowly allowed out into the rest of the house.<br><br>
                    <u>Kittens</u>: Most will acclimate & become comfortable fairly quickly to a new environment, but they still need to be isolated.
                    Theyre likely still getting the hang of using the litterbox, and if released into a large area, it may cause them to use the
                    bathroom elsewhere. Additionally, a safe room can be free from hazards, hiding places, & without items that could be damaged or
                    destroyed.<br><br>
                    <u>Pregnant/Nursing Moms</u>: They can be very protective over their little ones, and need a quiet place to birth, nurture, &
                    raise them until they are ready to be weaned. Too much space and exposure to other animals can cause her to give birth or relocate
                    her babies in an unideal location, or even stop caring for them altogether.<br><br>
                    <u>Resident Animals</u>: Even if your own pets seem to do well with new animals, it can still be stressful for new fosters being
                    in their home. Keeping fosters isolated will help eliminate some of that stress, and can also prevent negative interactions
                    between them, which can be damaging to both your pets and your fosters.

                  <p><strong>Decompression Period</strong><br>Give your foster some downtime to adjust to their new space. Spending some time sitting
                    in the room with your new foster may help them adjust. Avoid pulling or forcing the cat out of hiding. Instead, use smelly food,
                    treats, or toys to encourage them to come out. Be patient, let them come out on their own time. Some cats may need less than a day
                    to adjust, others may need days or weeks to become completely comfortable. This is normal cat behavior.<br><br>
                    <strong>Positive Interactions</strong><br>Focus on positive interactions with your foster cat. Pet them while they're eating this
                    helps them associate you with food. Use interactive toys, i.e. wand toys or even string - this helps them associate you with
                    playtime. Encourage them to come near you using food, treats, and toys. Reward them with treats and chin rubs. Avoid standing or
                    looming over your foster, as the cat may feel threatened.

                  <p><strong>Introducing Your Foster to Resident Cats</strong><br>When introducing your foster to resident cats, always supervise
                    their interactions. And separate them immediately should the introduction go poorly. Some hissing and growling is very common. Be
                    patient and take it slow. Allowing your foster and residents cats to gradually familiarize with each others scent and presence is
                    the best approach.<br><br>
                  <ul><strong>Stage 1: Scent</strong>
                    <li><u>Scent is the first introduction.</u>Your foster cat & resident cats will naturally sniff each other from under the door of
                      the safe room. Dont be alarmed if they initially hiss or seem anxious. Within 2-4 days, start exchanging bedding between your
                      foster and resident cats regularly.</li>
                    <li><u>Continue the sniffing.</u>Once there are no noticeable signs of aggression from the cats, i.e. hissing & growling, the next
                      step is to confine your resident cats to a room in the house, and let your foster cat start to explore one room at a time, for a
                      couple of hours each day for several days.</li>
                    <li><u>Swap.</u>Another option during this stage is to carefully allow the resident cats to explore the safe room while your
                      foster explores other rooms in the house. Swapping should be done carefully so that the cats dont actually cross one another.
                      First place your foster into a carrier, move to a different room & close the door. Next open the door to the safe room & allow
                      resident cats to enter, closing the door behind them. Finally - allow your foster out of the carrier. Repeat the process when
                      swapping back.</li><br><br>
                    <strong>Stage 2: Sight</strong>
                    <li><u>Carrier Meeting.</u>Place your foster in a carrier & set the carrier in a location in your home outside the safe room.
                      Allow the resident cats to investigate, see and sniff your foster through the carrier.</li>
                    <li><u>Gate Meeting.</u>Another option is to secure a baby or pet gate in the doorway of the safe room. Allow the cats to see and
                      sniff one another through the gate. Keep the visits short.</li>
                    <li><u>Repeat.</u>Continue this process at least once daily if possible, until the cats appear to be more comfortable with one
                      another.</li><br><br>
                    <strong>Stage 3: Meeting</strong>
                    <li><u>Supervise a Meeting.</u>Once comfortable at the sight of each other, crack the door open to the safe room. Always give them
                      the option to retreat into their safe room. Depending on personalities, your foster cat may venture outside their safe room, or
                      your resident cats may come to the safe room to visit. Supervision is required for the safety of all cats.</li>
                    <li><u>In Case of Aggression.</u>Always stop serious threats and/or aggressive behaviors immediately, as a serious fight could
                      damage the potential for successful integration and even result in injury. Try detering negative behaviors by redirecting their
                      attention to toys or treats. Using a spray bottle filled with water is also a safe, effective way to neutralize aggression. Once
                      neutralized, separate the cats ASAP.</li>
                    <li><u>Patience.</u>Some cats will take longer than others to become comfortable around other cats. Focus on positive interactions
                      between the cats as well as between you & the cats. You may notice some hissing, swatting, & overall grouchy behavior for a few
                      months. This is completely normal.</li>
                  </ul><br><br>
                  <p><strong>Introducing Your Foster to Resident Dogs</strong><br>
                  <ul>
                    <li><u>Scent.</u>Follow Stage 1 of “Cat Introductions.”</li>
                    <li><u>Sight.</u>Follow Stage 2 of “Cat Introductions.”</li>
                    <li><u>Meeting.</u>Arrange a meeting as described in Stage 3 of “Cat Introductions.” Youll want to have resident dogs on a leash a
                      well-trained/ well-behaved dog will make the introduction go much smoother. Dogs should be praised & rewarded for ignoring your
                      foster. Teach your dog not to fixate on your foster cat by redirecting their attention.</li>
                  </ul><br><br>
                  <p><strong>Introducing Kids to Your Foster</strong><br>Since we dont always know a foster cats history or tolerance level for
                    different types of people and activities, please teach your children how to act responsibly and respectfully around your fosters.
                    We do our best to place you with an appropriate foster that will be the best fit, but you should still supervise all interactions
                    between children and your foster.<br><br>
                  <ul><strong>Remind Children</strong>
                    <li><u>Always</u>leave the foster cat alone when he/she is eating or sleeping. Some cats may nip or bite if bothered while eating
                      or startled while sleeping.</li>
                    <li><u>Do Not</u>tease or rile up the foster cat.</li>
                    <li><u>Do Not</u>chase the foster cat around the house; it may scare him/her.</li>
                    <li><u>Be Careful</u>when opening & closing doors, so the cat isnt accidentally let outside or into a room he/she isnt supposed to
                      be in.</li><br><br>
                    <strong>Stage 2: Sight</strong>
                    <li><u>Carrier Meeting.</u>Place your foster in a carrier & set the carrier in a location in your home outside the safe room.
                      Allow the resident cats to investigate, see and sniff your foster through the carrier.</li>
                    <li><u>Gate Meeting.</u>Another option is to secure a baby or pet gate in the doorway of the safe room. Allow the cats to see and
                      sniff one another through the gate. Keep the visits short.</li>
                    <li><u>Repeat.</u>Continue this process at least once daily if possible, until the cats appear to be more comfortable with one
                      another.</li>

                outside of business hours for veterinary offices, then arrangements can be made for your foster to be seen at the local emergency vet
                (AECC). If an emergency situation arises and you are unable to reach the Cat Coordinator or another contact, then please use your best

                    Revolution is the medication that we keep on hand; we normally provide it to the foster home in a pre-dosed syringe to administer
                    to their foster cat(s).<br>○ Refer to the CVRR Cat Flea Treatment & Deworming document for more details.<br><br>
                    <strong>Vaccines</strong><br>○ All cats & kittens are vaccinated according to their age.<br>○ FVRCP is a combination vaccine that

                  <p>○ Diarrhea can be caused by several factors, including stress, change of diet, poor diet, eating garbage, parasites & viruses. If
                    your foster cat has diarrhea & has no other symptoms, rule out change of diet by feeding your cat a bland, consistent diet for a
                    day or two.<br><br>○ Provide plenty of fresh water since diarrhea can cause dehydration. To check for dehydration, pull the skin
                    up over the shoulder blades. If it snaps back quickly, the cat is not dehydrated. If the skin goes down slowly, then the cat is
                    dehydrated and may need fluids. Dehydration can be very dangerous for a kitten so contact your Cat Coordinator if you suspect your
                    foster is dehydrated, or if you notice other unusual symptoms along with diarrhea, such as extreme lethargy, vomiting,
                    etc.<br><br>○ If you notice diarrhea that persist for more than 48 hrs, you should get a fecal sample & contact the Cat
                    Coordinator to ask for a fecal test. Fecal samples should be placed in a ziploc bag & must be kept refrigerated until it can be
                    brought to a veterinary office.<br><br>○ If the diarrhea continues or gets worse, make a vet appointment through the Cat
                    Coordinator, & bring a fecal sample with you to the appointment if possible.</p>

                  <p><strong>Upper Respiratory Infections (URIs)</strong><br>○ Feline Upper Respiratory Infection (URI) is similar to a common cold in
                    humans, but it's not transmissible from cats to humans.<br><br>○ It is especially common in cats who have been exposed to a lot of
                    other cats, such as at an animal shelter or in an outdoor cat colony.<br><br>○ URIs are rarely fatal, and usually resolve within
                    1-3 weeks, but if left untreated, URIs can be deadly especially in young kittens.<br><br>○ Treatment generally consists of
                    supportive care. In addition, antibiotics are sometimes given to treat possible bacterial infections.<br><br>
                    <strong>How should you care for a cat with an URI?</strong><br>○ Mild cases of URI can often be treated at home with supportive
                    care. Provide the cat with a quiet, warm place to rest.<br><br>○ Be sure the cat is eating. When cats get stuffy noses, they can't
                    smell their food very well and may not want to eat. Offer extra smelly, wet food such as fish flavored canned cat food, or even
                    plain chicken baby food. Warming it up often helps.<br><br>○ Gently clean the cat's nose and eyes with a soft cloth moistened with
                    warm water. If the cat is very congested, use a humidifier or put the cat in the bathroom and run hot water in the shower for a
                    few minutes a couple of times a day.<br><br>○ Moderate to severe congestion is often a sign of a secondary bacterial infection, as
                    is yellow or green discharge, so contact the Cat Coordinator to discuss treatment.<br><br>
                    <u>If any medicine has been prescribed, be sure and give the full course as directed, even if the symptoms seem to have gone
                      away.</u>

                  <p><strong>Ear Mites</strong><br>○ Common in young cats, ear mites appear as a dark black waxy build-up in the ear.<br><br>○ Your
                    foster cat will likely be scratching at his/her ears or frequently shaking their head.<br><br>○ Ear mites can be treated with
                    Revolution, which is a topical medication that CVRR keeps on hand. The ears can also be cleaned daily with a Q-tip and mineral or
                    coconut oil.<br><br>
                    <strong>Parasites</strong><br>○ Parasites can cause diarrhea, stomach bloating or vomiting.<br><br>○ Parasites include tapeworms,
                    roundworms, hookworms and mange.<br><br>○ Tapeworms will look like pieces of rice coming out of your foster cat's anus or in their
                    stool.<br><br>○ Roundworms & hookworms may be vomited, and roundworms look like spaghetti (hookworms are smaller & rarely
                    distinguishable without the aid of a microscope).<br><br>○ Mange is an infestation of tiny mites that bite and cause intense
                    scratching, reddened skin & loss of fur. Only rare cases of mange (sarcoptic) are contagious to humans.<br><br>○ If you suspect
                    your foster cat has parasites, contact your Cat Coordinator to schedule a fecal test. Once diagnosed, parasites are easily
                    treated.

                  <p><strong>Panleukopenia</strong><br>○ Panleukopenia, also called feline Distemper or Panleuk, is closely related to canine
                    Parvovirus.<br><br>○ Panleuk is a highly contagious virus that an infected cat secretes in large amounts in all body secretions
                    including feces, vomit, urine, saliva, and mucus.<br><br>○ It is contagious to other cats but not to people or dogs.<br><br>○
                    Signs of infection are depression, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, fever and general malaise.<br><br>The virus is often
                    fatal and most commonly affects younger or unvaccinated cats. This virus can be deadly to cats & especially kittens. The FVRCP
                    vaccine protects against this disease.<br><br>
                    <strong>Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP)</strong><br>○ FIP is a very serious disease with nearly 100% mortality. It is not
                    contagious to people or dogs & moderately contagious to other cats.<br><br>○ FIP results from infection of the Corona virus and
                    nearly all cats & kittens living in shelter or communal living situations have been exposed to the virus. While exposure has taken
                    place, only a small percentage of exposed cats or kittens will convert the Corona virus to FIP. If converted, the disease leads to
                    the failure of the infiltrated organs, fevers unresponsive to antibiotics, & often the accumulation of thick yellow fluid in the
                    belly or chest.<br><br>○ Symptoms of FIP may include a distended abdomen, lethargy, lack of appetite, hanging head over food and
                    water bowl without eating or drinking. The cat or kitten will typically die within 1-2 weeks.

                <p><strong>Caring for a mom and her kittens is a very rewarding experience. And the best part is — mom does it all! She cleans up
                    after her babies, keeps them warm and maintains their feeding schedule.</strong><br><br>○ Caring for Mom. More than anything else,
                  a mother cat needs a calm, quiet environment to raise her family. If the mother cat is healthy, chances are, she will be able to
                  take care of her babies without much assistance from you. Your goal as the foster parent is to make sure she stays healthy and serve
                  as a back-up if there is a part of parenting she cannot do on her own.<br><br>○ Give Them Space. Even the sweetest cats can be
                  protective of their babies, so give the mom time to trust you. For the first couple days, only visit the family a few times to
                  ensure the babies are nursing and the mom appears healthy. Once you have earned the mother's trust, you can start interacting with
                  her babies.<br><br>○ Alleviate Stress. The more stress mom endures, the less she will be able to do for her babies. This includes
                  feeding them & caring for them properly. To minimize stress on the mother, never take the family out of your home or out of your
                  designated foster space. Ask that only the people directly involved in her foster care interact with the family. As the kittens get
                  older, you can welcome more people to interact with them.<br><br>
                  <strong>Feeding Pregnant & Nursing Cats</strong><br>Mama cat requires extra nutrition for adequate milk production. Feed a premium
                  diet three times each day. Kitten food is given to nursing moms to provide them extra nutrients. Nursing moms will typically be thin
                  and will sometimes have an unkempt coat while nursing. Be sure all the kittens are nursing and steadily gaining weight. Newborns
                  depend entirely on mom's first milk, receiving valuable antibodies (colostrum).<br><br>
                  <strong>Medical Care</strong><br>Call your Foster Coordinator if you see any signs of illness in mother or kittens. If the mother
                  cat goes off food or is stressed, milk production may drop sharply, and kittens may have to be raised as orphans. Check mother's
                  mammary glands daily for redness, harness, discharge or streaking color. A hard, red, hot or painful mammary gland may mean mastitis
                  which should be checked by a veterinarian. Contact your Cat Coordinator if you believe your nursing mother has this
                  condition.<br><br>As long as the kittens all nurse and gain weight, milk production is probably adequate. If milk production or
                  mother's calcium reserves are inadequate, the mother may develop eclampsia, an emergency situation of low blood calcium levels
                  requiring immediate attention. Symptoms include muscle twitching, tremors, anxiousness, progressive or stiffening, seizure-like
                  tremors.

                <p>Sometimes neonatal kittens are brought into our care without their mom. Caring for orphaned bottle baby kittens is both exhausting
                  & rewarding, and is not something everyone can do. It requires constant round-the-clock care, including feeding every few hours.
                  Bottle baby kittens without a mother are not appropriate fosters for people who work away from home.<br><br>

                <div class="accordion-body">
                  <p>Until three weeks of age, kittens need a substantial amount of bottle feeding. Since the mother is not available, the foster
                    parent must provide all of the mother's functions: feeding, warmth, cleaning and stimulation to urinate/defecate. There is no set
                    rule that applies to all litters of kittens, but there are guidelines to help you. We also highly recommend resources provided by
                    the <a href="http://www.kittenlady.org/">Kitten Lady</a>.<br><br>
                    <strong>Safety & Confinement</strong><br>○ These kittens should be set up in small living quarters (i.e. crate or box with
                    bedding), kept consistently warm at about 80-90 degrees. They will pile on each other to keep warm, but a hot water bottle and
                    warm bedding are needed. Heating pads can be dangerous. If used, they should be kept on low, with several layers of bedding
                    between the pad and kittens, and they should be monitored closely.<br><br>○ Under two weeks old: Chilling, diarrhea and
                    dehydration are the biggest killers of kittens this young. If they have been orphaned, you must assume that they are chilled. The
                    bedding arrangement must include a heating pad with plenty of padding between the kittens and the heat. A towel folded over once
                    to make two layers of towel is ideal. You can burn the kittens if you do not monitor them carefully.<br><br>
                    <strong>Keep Them Clean & Warm</strong><br>○ From birth on, kittens must be kept clean and warm.<br><br>○ They must also be kept
                    flea free; fleas can kill a kitten by causing severe anemia. Flea combing daily is usually enough, but for infestations, kittens
                    under 3 weeks old should be bathed in warm water and dawn dish soap.<br><br>○ Kittens are messy. They will likely need to be
                    bathed or cleaned with warm water when they get food on themselves, have excessive fleas, or have diarrhea. They must be
                    thoroughly dried after bathing to avoid becoming chilled, which can lead to illness or death. Wrapping them in a towel and drying
                    them vigorously and/or using a hair dryer on a low setting are recommended.<br><br>○ Change their bedding regularly. Kittens under
                    3 weeks old cannot regulate their body temperature. Keep them on a heating pad, set on low, wrapped in towels (at least two layers
                    of towels, or one towel folded over) should cover the pad. If it's too hot, the kittens will tend to sleep on the edges. The
                    heating pad should be used until the kittens are about four to five weeks old, or until you notice that they're avoiding it.

                  <p>Kitten milk replacer, such as KMR, should be mixed and fed according to package directions. Generally, feeding every 3 hours is
                    needed in the beginning. By 3-4 weeks of age, feeding every 4-5 hours with a night break of 8 hours should work well.<br><br>Milk
                    replacer can be fed by dropper, syringe or bottle as kittens accept it and need larger feedings. Some of the kittens may be too
                    weak to suck from the bottle and you will need to feed them with syringes. If you need to syringe-feed the kittens, drip the
                    formula slowly into the side of their mouths, and give them time to swallow. Going too fast can cause liquid to go into their
                    lungs and cause pneumonia.<br><br>Do not hold kittens on their backs, or allow them to suck too fast, as this can lead to
                    aspiration of formula into the lungs. The kittens should be tilted forward and slightly up, as if they were nursing on their
                    mother. Never try to bottle feed an unconscious or semi-conscious kitten.<br><br>Feed until the kitten's tummy feels tight and
                    full. Sick kittens will not eat eagerly, and you will have to feed them slowly and often to ensure they are getting enough food.
                    After each feeding, you must stimulate bowel and bladder movement. Use a warm, damp cotton ball or later a cloth as volume
                    increases. Mineral oil on a Q-tip at the anus may stimulate defecation. Gently massage their genital areas in a circular motion
                    and do not stop until they have finished eliminating.<br><br>Note the color of the urine. If it is light yellow or straw colored,
                    this is normal. If it is a bright canary yellow, the kitten is dehydrated and needs fluids immediately. Cottage cheesy stools or
                    diarrhea are also an indication of illness. Contact your Cat Coordinator if you see these symptoms.<br><br>

                <div class="accordion-body">
                  <p>○ 3-4 weeks: Weaning can be started at 3 weeks by offering formula in a low dish or pie plate with or without canned food mixed
                    in. Be sure to offer when kittens are hungry, so they will make their best effort to lap/lick/eat. Supplement with bottle or
                    syringe feedings as needed until kittens are lapping consistently from a dish.<br><br>○ 4-5 weeks: By 4 weeks old, the kittens
                    have enough teeth to begin experimenting with solid foods. During this first week of weaning, place some canned cat food in the
                    center of a low-sided dish, mixed with kitten formula to create a “slop”. Using your finger, put a little bit of food onto their
                    mouths and then show them the food dish. Do this several times until they drop their heads to eat. Don't be surprised if they walk
                    in the food. You may still need to supplement bottle feedings, but by 5 weeks no more bottle feedings should be needed. You should
                    also start leaving a small bowl of water in their feeding area at this age.<br><br>○ 5 weeks: At 5 weeks, offer wet food without
                    any milk replacement formula mixed in (try using some warm water instead) and begin offering dry food as well. You can start this
                    by mixing some dry food into their wet food. Continue feeding the wet food/kibble mixture until 7 weeks or so.<br><br>○ 8 weeks:
                    By 8 weeks, the kittens should readily eat dry food with decreasing amounts of wet food 2-3 times/day.</p>

                <p>○ Introducing cats to a new environment is a careful, and often-times slow, process.<br><br>○ Cats become extremely overwhelmed &

                  or even weeks.<br><br>○ A confined “safe room” is the most effective way to introduce cats to an unfamiliar place.<br><br>○ When
                  frightened, cats feel safest in a small, dark hiding space. Provide your foster with an appropriate hiding space, i.e. covered bed,
                  carrier without the door, crate with a blanket draped over top, or even a cardboard box.<br>

                  <p>○ Cats use different body postures to communicate their emotions.<br>○ When observing your cat, you may notice that he/she
                    behaves differently when alone & when in contact with other animals and people.<br>○ As cats become more anxious about their
                    surroundings, their body language may change quickly depending on the perceived threat.<br><br>

                    <strong>Sleeping & Relaxing</strong><br>○ Cats love high places to perch and look around, as well as cozy, safe places to hide and
                    sleep.<br>○ Letting your cat sleep on furniture and relax on your lap will make your cat feel more “at home.”<br>○ Remember that
                    cats are largely nocturnal by nature. So your bedtime may not be the same as your cat's. Your cat's increased activity during the
                    night or early morning is not a behavioral problem - just instinct. You can help curb this behavior by playing with your cat with
                    toys right before bedtime to tire them out.

                  <p><strong>1 box per cat +1</strong><br>Have you ever had to share your bathroom with a less than ideal roommate? Your cat may enjoy
                    the company of their fellow friends, but sharing their box is a different matter.<br><br>To keep the peace, we recommend having
                    one litter box per cat, plus one more. This means that in a house with two cats, we recommend at least 3 litter boxes in various
                    locations of the house.<br><br>
                    <strong>Keep it Clean</strong><br>No one likes a filthy toilet, and your cat will agree. Solid waste and clump should be scooped
                    daily, and a complete wash of the box should happen at least once a month.<br><br>
                    <strong>Cat Chooses the Litter</strong><br>We suggest using a litter that is plain and unscented, but the choice is ultimately up
                    to the cat. If the a cat is used to a certain type of litter, we recommend sticking with it. Cat's prefer a routine and stability
                    and changing the type of litter can cause stress and inappropriate elimination.<br><br>
                    <strong>Cat Chooses the Box</strong><br>We recommend starting with your basic open litterbox, but every cat is different. Some
                    cats prefer large, low-sided litterboxes, others prefer a hooded or high-sided litterbox.<br><br>
                    <strong>Note:</strong>If a cat is using the bathroom close to but outside of the litterbox, then try changing to a different type
                    of litter or a different type of litterbox & see if that resolves the problem.<br><br>
                    <hr>
                    <strong>Litter Box Issues</strong><br>Try the following to help solve litter box problems:<br><br>
                    <u>Rule out Illness</u><br>The first step to take if you notice your cat is not using their litter box is to discuss this with a
                    veterinarian to rule out medical issues as the underlying cause. Contact the foster team to discuss the next steps.<br><br>
                    <u>Clean up all the Mess</u><br>Any area that has been soiled should be cleaned properly with an enzyme-based cleaner. Cleaners
                    that have this will break down the urine/stool traces in areas that you might not be able to see, but the cats can smell.<br><br>
                    <u>Prevention & Redirection</u><br>If you are still in the process of housetraining, or if you have already followed the above
                    steps, make sure you limit the access of the house. This could mean a large crate or a small easily cleanable room (i.e. bathroom
                    or laundry room) to help re-train the cat to use the litterbox.<br><br>

                  <p>○ Some cats are gentle while others are rowdy and prone to nipping or biting.<br><br>○ Biting, even while playing, is
                    normal.<br><br>○ There are even some cats who give “love bites,” which are just little nibbles, usually on the hands and fingers,
                    while they are in an affectionate mood.<br><br>○ You can discourage playful biting and avoid getting bitten by never using your
                    hand as a toy but rather encourage play through interactive toys.<br><br>○ Biting may also be your cats way of saying they've had
                    enough petting or playing. If this happens, stop what youre doing immediately, and leave your cat alone to cool down.<br><br>○
                    Many cats have their own “no-pet zone” where petting, handling, or even touching may lead to biting. Bellies are an area many cats

                  <p>Cats like to scratch. They scratch during play. They scratch while stretching. They scratch to mark territory. And because cats'
                    claws need regular sharpening, cats scratch on things to remove frayed, worn outer claws and expose new, sharper claws. And yes,
                    all this scratching can cause a lot of damage to furniture, drapes and carpeting.. BUT there are ways you can keep cats happy and
                    prevent damage to your home.<br><br>The best tactic when dealing with scratching is not to try to stop the cat from scratching,
                    but instead, to teach where and what to scratch. An excellent approach is to provide appropriate, cat-attractive surfaces and
                    objects to scratch, such as scratching posts.
                    <hr>
                    <strong>What to do about Bad Scratching Habits</strong><br>○ Provide a variety of scratching posts with different qualities &
                    surfaces. Try posts made of cardboard, carpeting, wood, sisal & upholstery. Once you figure out the cat's preference for
                    scratching, provide additional posts of that kind in various locations. Keep in mind that all cats want a sturdy post that won't
                    shift or collapse when used.<br><br>○ Encourage your foster to investigate posts by scenting them with catnip, hanging toys on
                    them and placing them in areas where they'll be inclined to climb on them.<br><br>○ Discourage inappropriate scratching by
                    removing or covering other desirable objects.<br><br>○ Put plastic, double-sided sticky tape, sandpaper or upside-down vinyl
                    carpet runner (knobby parts up) on furniture or on the floor where your foster would stand to scratch your furniture. Place
                    scratching posts next to these objects, as “legal” alternatives.<br><br>○ Clip the cat's nails regularly.<br><br>○ Consider
                    putting plastic caps on the cat's claws so that they'll do no damage if they scratch on something in your home. These special caps
                    attach to claws with an adhesive. They're temporary, lasting four to six weeks.<br><br>○ If you catch a cat in the act of
                    scratching an inappropriate object, you can try startling them by clapping your hands or squirting with water. Use this procedure
                    only as a last resort, because the cat may associate you with the startling event (clapping or squirting) and learn to fear you.

                  <p>Despite the term "declaw," it's important to understand that this surgery involves more than claw removal. The last bone of the
                    digit must be amputated to make sure the claw does not grow back. Some people decide to declaw their cats to prevent or resolve a
                    scratching problem.<strong>We are strongly opposed to declawing cats and will not provide any cats with a declawing surgery unless
                      medically necessary.</strong><br><br>Declawing has<u>NOT</u>been proven an effective method for improving behavioral issues,
                    including aggression towards people or other cats. It can also cause arthritis. It should never be used as a behavioral remedy or
                    as a preventative measure. The only circumstances in which the procedure should be considered are those in which all behavioral &
                    environmental alternatives have been fully explored, have proven to be ineffective, and the cat is at grave risk of
                    euthanasia.<br><br>A variety of alternatives exist to manage natural scratching behavior, behavioral issues & to prevent injury.
                    These alternatives include: trimming the cats nails regularly, providing scratching surfaces for the cat to use, using deterrents
                    such as double-sided tape to protect furnishings, & covering the claws with Soft Paws. Pet parents should also be familiar with
                    cat behavior and proper handling techniques to avoid being scratched.</p>

                  <p>Like humans, cats would rather be praised rather than punished. Positive reinforcement means giving your cat something pleasant
                    or rewarding immediately after he/she does something you want them to do. Since your praise or reward makes your cat more likely
                    to repeat that behavior in the future, it's one of your most powerful tools for shaping or modifying your cat's
                    behavior.<strong>It's more effective to teach a cat what they should do, rather than what they shouldn't.</strong><br><br>
                    <u>Correct timing</u>is essential when using positive reinforcement. The reward must occur immediately, within seconds, or your
                    cat may not associate it with their action.<br><br>
                    <u>Consistency</u>is also an important part of positive reinforcement training. Everyone in the household should reward the same
                    desired behaviors in order to be effective.<br><br>When your pet's first learning a new behavior, i.e. using a scratching post
                    instead of your couch, reward them anytime you catch them using the scratching post. You can also help encourage the behavior by
                    putting some catnip on the post, dangling their favorite toy, or even using a laser pointer.<br><br>Once your cat reliably offers
                    the desired behavior, you may reward them with treats intermittently, e.g. 3 out of 4 times they do the behavior. Then, over time,
                    reward them less & less, until you're only rewarding with an occasional treat. Continue praising the behavior.
